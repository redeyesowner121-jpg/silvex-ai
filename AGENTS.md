- Telegram browsing screens use the short-lived in-memory catalogue cache; final purchases always re-read product and user data for correctness and safety.
- Telegram channel membership is checked only on `/start`; non-members may skip the prompt and continue using the bot.
- Supplier refreshes triggered by Telegram are single-flight and locally limited to once per minute to prevent interaction traffic from creating overlapping sync work.
Pandora Digital provider added to PROVIDERS (id 'pandora', string product ids, Idempotency-Key header, available_balance).
- Telegram button presentation settings live under `site_settings/button_colors`, `button_names`, and `product_buttons`; emoji metadata stays under `telegramEmoji` so premium IDs are preserved.
- Bot purchases deduct wallet and claim auto-stock via ETag transactions (`dbTransact`), refund automatically when automatic delivery fails, and split bulk deliveries into multiple messages plus a .txt file — prevents duplicate accounts, lost money and Telegram's 4096-char limit.
- Supplier orders send both `qty` and `quantity` — shops disagree on the field name and silently default to 1.
- Supplier stock changes (back in stock, +5 or more with a 3h per-product cooldown, new imports) are announced via a background queue, combined into one digest when several change; Railway also runs a 2-minute supplier check timer.
- Broadcasts run one at a time (`runBroadcast` lane), are tagged `_broadcast` so `tg()` can pause them on 429s, and shrink free-mode waves while customers use the bot — keeps live replies responsive.
- Website wallet changes (checkout, cancel refunds, crypto deposits, signup referral) run server-side in src/lib/wallet.server.ts after verifying the Firebase ID token; Firebase rules forbid customers writing wallet/history/referral fields — prevents self-credited balances.
- Firebase rules live in `database.rules.json` (push via REST `.settings/rules`); products and `site_settings/config|smtp|providers` are admin-only, customers get products/config through the server snapshot with secret keys stripped — prevents leaking stock, bot token and payment keys.
- Admin rights in rules require both the `isAdmin` flag and a permanent-owner email — a stray `isAdmin` flag alone grants nothing.
- Lovable Cloud schema: customers (legacy_uid ↔ Firebase uid, auth_user_id nullable for Telegram-only), roles in user_roles via has_role/is_staff, stock in private product_stock claimed by claim_stock(), money via wallet_adjust()/claim_payment() — row-locked atomic changes replace Firebase ETag transactions; bot-internal nodes live in kv_store keyed by path.
- scripts/copy-firebase-to-cloud.py reloads Cloud from a Firebase JSON export in DO-block batches (sandbox DB role is insert-only, so wipes go through run_sql).

- Server data access goes through Firebase-style paths in telegram.server db* helpers; `DATA_BACKEND=cloud` routes them to src/lib/cloud-db.server.ts (users/products/orders/site_settings → tables, everything else → kv_store, CAS on updated_at). Why: switch the bot over with one setting, no rewrite of ~300 calls.
